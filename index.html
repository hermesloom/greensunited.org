    <h1>Greens United</h1>
    <p>
      Greens United is an informal association of all people supporting green values, but feeling like the Green party has betrayed them.
      It is an acknowledgement that contemporary "green" politics, on the level influencing large chunks of the population, are often actively
      counterproductive to realizing the goals they have. It is an initiative by, for and from people who strongly believe that, if the
      "greens" were just a tad bit more intelligent and actually serious, they could have a genuine impact. But they don't, simply because the
      decision makers in the parliament are too corrupt and have a lack of depth in how they differ from all the other parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Greens United, we strive to take over all "Green Parties" in the world, for example "Bündnis 90/Die Grünen". Obviously, by definition,
      in a democratic way, because people <i>want</i> to vote for us, because we will just do it better. We are not a party ourselves, we are
      just those who want to do it better, in a decentralized way. This page isn't even a communication channel for anyone; if you want to find
      others who you want to work together with, the only thing you can do is to refer to "greensunited.org" in the social groups you're already
      a part of.

      Participation in Greens United requires two prerequisites:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Believing in each other's well intention.</li>
      <li>Insatiable, consistent urge to understand each other and to come to terms as decentralized unity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For novices, this is often hard to achieve in a consistent way, due to different upbringings and due to segregation of people in cities
      (in contrast to community living); both typically reinforce each other. Also, many pains cannot or can only very hardly be understood by
      those who didn't go through them as a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "green" I mean is not institutional, it's not hierarchical, because it is a genuine representation of the people. It is not "let's
      have our party leaders and let them ruin everything", but "let's actually question the power structures in our party as well as the
      organization structure altogether". It doesn't mean "doing it like any other party does it". "Green" doesn't mean rigid and static, it
      means lushness, flourishing, <i>actually</i> having a good life <i>together</i>. Right now, "green" politicians do nothing substantial
      to properly improving democracy <i>proactively</i>, but they only say "only if we're in the government, we can do anything".
    </p>
    <p>
      Green thinking is like mycelium, it means interconnection and fast transmission, regeneration, a better life for humans and the planet.
      It is not a political agenda, it's a lifestyle, a way to do business, a culture. But, in contrast to other cultures, it doesn't
      aim to "take over" other cultures, but instead just weaves its net of nourishing of people who just want to genuinely be good for and
      to each other. It's not an actual association, but instead more like a manifesto, an expression of "hey, i exist! let's be grounded
      together, barefoot on the actual earth, and let's talk about it".
    </p>
    <p>
      For many, it means acquiring an immense new level of compassion and empathy. In their thoughts, many make rich people become devils.
      In many cases, this is very much justified, that's absolutely clear. But just dehumanizing them is not the solution.
      When we want to cause actual change, we are not "against" anyone. Communicate your rules for life and for your interaction with
      every new person proactively and be transparent with them from the get-go.
